# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

A repository containing Data Structures Laboratory programs in C corresponding to the syllabus of ISL36 from the Department of Information Science Engineering at Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore.

## Programs

1. **Student Information using Structures** (`program1.c`)
   - Reads and calculates details of multiple students using structures and dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Dynamic Array Resizing** (`program2.c`)
   - Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and reallocation for an integer array.

3. **Stack Implementation** (`program3.c`)
   - Implements a stack with `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `display` operations. Includes a program illustrating forward and backward surfing in a web browser using a stack (Array implementation), with appropriate exception messages.

4. **Infix to Postfix Conversion** (`program4.c`)
   - Converts a given valid parenthesized infix arithmetic expression to postfix using a stack data structure.

5. **Postfix Expression Evaluation** (`program5.c`)
   - Evaluates a valid postfix expression using a stack. Assumes the postfix expression consists of non-negative single-digit operands and binary operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

6. **Queue Implementation** (`program6.c`)
   - Simulates a call center phone system using a queue data structure. Provides options to add and remove phone calls in the order of their arrival for service.

7. **Circular Queue Implementation** (`program7.c`)
   - Demonstrates round-robin processor scheduling using a circular queue (array implementation) with options to add, remove, and display elements.

8. **Singly Linked List Implementation** (`program8.c`)
   - Illustrates memory allocation to files based on their size using a singly linked list. Supports operations such as inserting a node, deleting a node, and displaying the list.

9. **Doubly Linked List Implementation** (`program9.c`)
   - Extends memory allocation to files based on their size using a doubly linked list. Supports operations such as inserting a node, deleting a node, and displaying the list.

10. **Stack Operations with Peek** (`program10.c`)
   - Enhances the stack implementation with a `peek` operation and extends the menu in the main function to include peeking.

11. **Queue Operations with Enqueue and Dequeue** (`program11.c`)
   - Implements basic queue operations with `enqueue` and `dequeue`. Extends the menu in the main function to include enqueueing and dequeuing.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc program_name.c -o program_name`).
3. Run the compiled executable (e.g., `./program_name`).

Feel free to explore each program to grasp the concepts and use them as reference material for learning data structures and algorithms in C.
