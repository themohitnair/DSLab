# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains C programs demonstrating various data structures and algorithms. Each program is accompanied by a brief explanation.

## Programs

1. **Student Information**
   - Reads and calculates details of multiple students using structures and dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Dynamic Array Resizing**
   - Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and reallocation for an integer array.

3. **Stack Implementation**
   - Implements a stack with push, pop, peek, and display operations.

4. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**
   - Converts an infix expression to postfix using a stack.

5. **Postfix Expression Evaluation**
   - Evaluates a postfix expression using a stack.

6. **Queue Implementation**
   - Implements a queue with enqueue, dequeue, and display operations.

7. **Circular Queue Implementation**
   - Implements a circular queue with enqueue, dequeue, and display operations.

8. **Linked List Implementation**
   - Implements a linked list with insert and delete operations at the head/tail.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc program_name.c -o program_name`).
3. Run the compiled executable (e.g., `./program_name`).

Feel free to explore each program to understand the concepts and use them as reference material for learning data structures and algorithms in C.
